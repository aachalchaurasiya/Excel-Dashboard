Sales Performance Tracker – Excel Dashboard

This project is an interactive Excel dashboard that helps track and compare sales performance in a simple, visual way. You don’t need to be an Excel expert to use it — just open the file and start exploring!

What It Does?

This dashboard automatically finds and displays:

🏆 Top 5 Salespersons – The best performers based on sales.

📉 Bottom 5 Salespersons – The lowest performers.

🎯 Top 5 Closest to Target – People who are just about to reach their sales goal.

🚀 Top 5 Who Need a Push – Those who are slightly behind in reaching the target.

Why It’s Useful

Saves time by automatically sorting and ranking salespeople.

Gives managers a quick snapshot of performance without going through large datasets.

Helps make data-driven decisions about rewards, training, or support.

How It Works

Built in Microsoft Excel using formulas, charts, and VBA Macros (to automate calculations).

You can filter, sort, and interact with the dashboard without touching the raw data.

Just update the sales data, and everything else updates automatically.
